### lavanda
`/laβˈanda/` The color of lavender is a delicate blend of deep purples and gentle pinks, a tranquil and soothing hue that seems to ripple with a gentle breeze. It is a color that brings to mind fields of blooming flowers, the first blush of dawn, and the stillness of a summer's eve. The lavender hue is both ethereal and grounding, a harmonious blend of light and shadow, of the intangible and the tangible.
