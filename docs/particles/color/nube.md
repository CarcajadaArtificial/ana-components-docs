### nube
`/nˈuβe/` The light violet hue of cloud scattering is a breathtaking display of the symphony between the sun and the atmosphere. As the celestial ball of fire dips low on the horizon, its rays dance through the curtains of the sky, illuminating the clouds with a delicate lavender hue. This ethereal shade is the result of the Tyndall effect, where the shorter violet and blue wavelengths are scattered and dispersed, creating a dreamlike atmosphere. It is a testament to the beauty of nature and the infinite marvels of the heavens.
