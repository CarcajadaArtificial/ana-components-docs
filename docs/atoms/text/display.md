### type
Each type of text serves a unique purpose, and when used in concert, they form a symphony of information, guiding the user through the labyrinth of digital interfaces. Their precise and calculated placement, size, and style, hold the power to convey meaning, evoke emotions, and inspire action.

#### display
The *display* text type is the largest of them all. It is used for impactful text that requires a larger amount of screenspace to convey an extremely important message. It is an opportunity to create visual impact and set the tone for the overall design. I think things like brand mottos, hot takes, or one-sentence announcement work great for a *display* type. It represents the designer's voice and intention, guiding the user's experience. 
* **Avoid this text type on devices with smaller screens.**
