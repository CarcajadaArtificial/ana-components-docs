#### title

A *title* is a text type that is used in the largest true heading. A [display](#display) type must **not** be used as a "larger title". A *title* type would function as a page title perfectly well. Ideally, there would be a need for only one _title_; anything else should be able to fit on the [heading](#heading) and [subheading](#subheading) text types.
