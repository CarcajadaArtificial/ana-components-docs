#### inheritColor

This property will remove any color setting on the text component and instead, it will add `color: inherit;` to its styles. This way one could assign a text color from a higher element and this text will just inherit it.

#### `[JSX]` Component
  ```html
<Text inheritColor>Chapter I: Down the Rabbit-Hole</Text>
```
