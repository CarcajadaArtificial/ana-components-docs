#### subheading

The *subheading* type is useful when one of the page's parts has too much content that needs further divisions. A *subheading* is significantly larger than a paragraph and is bold like the other heading types, but it is the only one that has a normal text color. **This type must not be used as a "smaller" version of a heading or a title.**
