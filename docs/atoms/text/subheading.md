#### subheading

The *subheading* type is used to further divide the content into smaller sections and provide additional context. It can refine the user's understanding of the content and give it more clarity. A *subheading* has the base color like the paragraph does but is significantly larger and bold like the other heading types. 
* **This type must not be used as a "smaller" version of a [heading](#heading) or a [title](#title).**
