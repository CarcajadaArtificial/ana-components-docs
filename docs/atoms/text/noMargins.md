### Component Props

#### noMargins

This property is used for only removing the margins from any text type. This is useful when the margins add too much white space in certain unique layouts (e.g. A text component being a child of a *CSS grid* with a fixed gap). Not to be confused with the [compressed](#compressed) component property that reduces the element's `line-height`.

#### `[JSX]` Component
  ```html
<Text type="subheading" noMargins>Chapter I: Down the Rabbit-Hole</Text>
```
