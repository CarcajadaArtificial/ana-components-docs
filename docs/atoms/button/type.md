### type
In an interface, the property of button type wields significant influence over its appearance, specifically in regard to the contrast between its color and the background behind it. Abstaining from hierarchical naming conventions such as "primary" and "secondary," the types are named to reflect the contrasting hues of the theme's colors.

#### contrast
Contrast buttons are typically used to initiate the main action in a user interface, such as submitting a form or confirming a purchase. They are usually designed to stand out and be highly visible to the user, making it clear what the most important action is.
